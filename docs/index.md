# BCG Digital Venture Developer Portal

The BCG Digital Venture Developer Portal is based on [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/). For documentation on how to use and extend the dashboard, refer to the [official documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/architecture-overview).

## Adding New Project

### Catalog File

New projects can be automatically discovered and added to the dashboard. To do so, you need to add a catalog file to the root of your repository. The catalog file is a YAML file that contains information about the project.

For details about how to create catalog file, refer the doc [catelog file description](./devportal-catalog-description.md).

### Project Documentation

 Project Documentation is under `docs` folder under repository root directory and consists of a list of markdown files that are part of the repository and are changed and committed along with the rest of the source code. All updates to the project documentation will automatically be reflected in the development dashboard once merged into target branch. You can add new pages to the navigation by editing the `mkdocs.yml` file in the project root directory via adding new entries to the `nav` section in the file. The documentation is created using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/) and the [TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/techdocs-overview) as a Backstage plugin. 

Detail and related usage could be found [here](./project-documentation.md).

### Swagger/OpenAPI Spec

If your project provides a public API, it is recommended to add a `openapi.json` file to the project root directory. The file contains information about the API and is used by the development dashboard to generate the documentation. Ideally the file is automatically generated as part of the build process of the project.
